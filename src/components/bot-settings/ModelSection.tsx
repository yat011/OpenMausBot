// Model: which provider/model this bot runs on, and how hard it thinks.

// this section sits inside the dialog's overflow-y-auto scroller, where the
// picker's floating popover (absolute, ~480px tall) would open below the
// fold and only become visible by scrolling; the in-flow menu pushes the
// Effort card down instead and is fully visible where it opens.
