/**
 * The three affordances a transcript grows when the reply is more than prose —
 * the port of `ios/App/Cards/GitPRDiffCardView.swift` and
 * `ios/App/Cards/AgentThoughtChamberView.swift`, plus Android's own data-table
 * card. iOS now draws a pipe table as markdown; matching that is issue 1707.
 *
 * Whether a reply *is* one of these is `TranscriptCards` in `:core`, and it is
 * strict on purpose: a card that swallowed a paragraph would hide the answer
 * inside it. This file is only the drawing, and it is Material drawing. The iOS
 * cards are gradients over `.ultraThinMaterial` with Tailwind hexes; the same
 * information here is a tonal surface, the app's own palette for the two colours
 * a diff actually means (added, removed), and Material's divider and text
 * button. What is not free, and is kept exactly: the whole patch on the
 * clipboard, RFC 4180 quoting, the 80-line preview, and a chamber that starts
 * closed.

/**
 * A table the reader can actually read across, and take away as CSV.
 *
 * Read across in the literal sense: heading row first, then one row at a time,
 * left to right, one row at a time. iOS no longer builds this card (issue
 * 1707). This used to be the transpose of a row of columns, a `Row` of
 * self-measuring `Column`s, and on an API 34 emulator TalkBack duly announced
 * *"LANGUAGE, Python, Java, Rust, YEAR, 1991, 1995, 2010"*: every value of the
 * first column before the second, so `Python`↔`1991` was not a row at all for
 * a reader who cannot see the screen. The composition decided that order, and
 * it built it the wrong way round.
 *
 * Composition order is not the whole of the answer:
 * `AndroidComposeViewAccessibilityDelegateCompat` runs its own traversal pass
 * over the merged tree, groups nodes by geometry and publishes
 * `traversalBefore`/`traversalAfter` relations from that grouping. Here the two
 * stages agree, because the children are emitted row-major and then placed
 * row-major, so neither has anything left to reorder. That agreement is the
 * reason the fix holds, not an excuse to skip the check: `TableReadingOrderTest`
 * pins the tree, and TalkBack on a device is what pins the reading.
 *
 * Holding both — the row order *and* columns that still line up — is why the
 * grid is its own [Layout] rather than a `Row` or a `Column` of anything. The
 * children arrive row-major, which is the order the reader gets; the measure
 * pass then widens each column to its widest cell, which is the alignment iOS
 * gives up by handing every cell the same `minWidth` and letting them drift.
 * The rules come last on purpose, and this is the point the old comment here
 * made and it still holds: inside a horizontal scroll the incoming width is
 * unbounded and `fillMaxWidth` against an unbounded constraint measures zero,
 * so a rule is only as wide as its column if something measures the column
 * first and then hands it that width.

 * A copy, as the two halves iOS gives it: the clipboard write, and the tick that

 * unconditionally — so Copy Diff and Android's Copy CSV are confirmed by feel
 * and not only by a toast. iOS markdown tables do not offer Copy CSV (issue 1707).
 * neither platform shows. A copy is the one action on these cards with no
 * visible result at all: the button does not move, nothing opens, and the only
 * evidence is in a clipboard the reader has to leave the app to see. That is
 * exactly the interaction that needs the confirmation.
 *
 * Both cards go through this one object, so neither route can lose the tick
 * without the other losing it too — and [invoke] plays exactly one cue per call,
 * after the write is dispatched, in the order the Swift does it.
