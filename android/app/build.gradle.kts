// The release signing key belongs to the maintainer and never enters this
// repository. It reaches a build from one of two places outside version
// control:
//
//   * `android/keystore.properties` — gitignored, for signing by hand. Four
//     keys: `storeFile` (a path, absolute or relative to `android/`),
//     `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, and optionally `keyPassword`.
//   * the environment — for CI, where the material arrives as secrets:
//     OPENMAUSBOT_KEYSTORE_FILE, OPENMAUSBOT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD,
//     OPENMAUSBOT_KEY_ALIAS, and optionally OPENMAUSBOT_KEY_PASSWORD.
//
// The environment wins over the file, so a runner cannot silently inherit a
// stale `keystore.properties` left behind in a cached workspace.
//
// When none of it is present the release build is unsigned, and that is a
// supported outcome rather than a degraded one: `assembleRelease` writes
// `app-release-unsigned.apk` for the maintainer to sign with his own key on his
// own machine. A signed build writes `app-release.apk` instead, so the filename
// alone says which of the two happened.
