/**
 * What the harness says it did with a message the moment it was posted.
 *
 * A send is not one outcome. When the bot is idle the line lands in the
 * transcript and a turn starts. When the bot is mid-turn there are two more:
 * an engine with a live session can take the words INTO the running turn
 * ([Sent.steered]), and one that cannot has the harness hold them
 * off-transcript until the turn settles ([Queued]) — deliberately
 * off-transcript, because a held line appended now would become the active
 * leaf and the rest of the running turn would hang off something the model
 * never saw.
 *
 * The distinction only exists in the POST's 202 body. A client that throws
 * that body away, as this one used to, shows nothing at all for a queued
 * send: the composer clears and the words reappear minutes later, or not at
 * all. So the receipt is the contract, and it is decoded, not ignored.
