// What the agents proxy puts on the wire for `tools/list`, pinned byte for
// byte and measured.
//
// Two jobs:
//
// 1. GOLDEN. Every engine turns this JSON into its provider's function-call
//    format, and a schema that changes shape in passing has broken production
//    before (#544: a `oneOf` mangled by a provider's conversion). So the exact
//    serialized result is checked in for every mount profile the harness can
//    ask for, and a refactor of the proxy has to reproduce it to the byte.
//    The proxy is spawned the way a driver's mcpServers entry spawns it, from
//    source and from the esbuild bundle every packaged build ships, so "the
//    same bytes" is a statement about the real process, not about a helper.
//
// 2. WIRE SIZE. The catalog is sent to the model on every turn. The often
//    quoted "~37 KB" was a count of indented source, not of this JSON. The
//    numbers printed here are the real ones, and the budget below fails CI
//    when a profile grows by more than 2%.
//
// Changing a tool on purpose: run this file once with
// UPDATE_AGENTS_CATALOG_GOLDENS=1, review the golden diff like any other wire
// change, and move BUDGET_BASELINE by hand. The baseline is deliberately not
// rewritten by the update run: growth should be a decision somebody typed.
