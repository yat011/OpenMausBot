// The harness-side verdict for connected-app tool calls (issue #1736, part
// of the per-bot Composio tool grants umbrella #1734).
//
// Every Composio tool call crosses POST /api/internal/connectors/mcp: the
// provider CLIs talk to the stdio bridge, and the bridge forwards each
// JSON-RPC frame there. So the grants verdict lives on the harness side,
// where the loopback token already names the bot and the decision log is
// native — the bridge never sees a key it could have to enforce with.
//
// Three shapes reach this module:
//
//   * a direct per-toolkit call — params.name is the tool itself, e.g.
//     GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL;
//   * the executor meta-tool — COMPOSIO_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL, whose
//     arguments name one or many target tools;
//   * everything else — connection cards, discovery, notifications —
//     which passes through untouched (advertisement filtering is slice 3).
//
// Unrecognized argument shapes are denied by default: a call whose target
// tools cannot be read is a call whose tools cannot be checked, and the
// grants promise — "this bot may call exactly these tools" — must hold
// even against a model that garbles the protocol.
