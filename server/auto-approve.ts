//
// Nothing here decides whether an action is safe. Each approval level is a
// provider's own permission mode passed straight through (Claude `auto`,
// Grok `--permission-mode`, Codex `approvalsReviewer`, …), and a request that
// reaches this process is one the provider left for a person. The only
// verdict the app synthesizes is Full access, because that level is the
// person's explicit, separately confirmed grant to answer every prompt.
// Questions never come through here: a bot's question always reaches a human.
