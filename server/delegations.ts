// Async peer handoff (delegate_bot).
//
// A bot that finishes one task can hand the NEXT task to a peer without
// blocking its own turn — the source bot's turn.completed fires after it
// settles, and the queued delegation runs then. The peer gets a fresh
// depth-1 turn (depth cap still blocks A→B→C chains, see index.ts).
//
// Visiblity rides on the same comms-visibility helpers ask_bot uses
// (channel mirror + 1:1 chips) so a delegated exchange looks like an
// exchanged one. The optional approval gate (A2) is checked at drain
// time, never at queue time, because the user might have just turned
// approvePeerComms on between queueing and draining.
