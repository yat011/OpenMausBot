// Harness-native peer-comm approval gate.
//
// A bot with `approvePeerComms = true` may not call ask_bot or
// delegate_bot without a human approving the specific contact. The
// approval rides on the same options-card flow provider permissions
// already use: a card pushed into the SOURCE bot's thread with a
// `requestId`, answered by the user via /api/bots/:id/respond (or
// /api/threads/:id/respond) which the harness intercepts via
// `resolvePeerComms` BEFORE forwarding to the provider adapter. That
// way nothing front-end has to learn about peer comms.
//
// "Always allow" rides on the existing per-bot `alwaysAllow` list. The
// card carries an ID-based `allowKey` and
// the user-facing Always-allow flow already mirrors that key back into
// `alwaysAllow`, so the two sides never disagree about what was granted.
