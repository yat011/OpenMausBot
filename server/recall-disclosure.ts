// When a bot answers in a room using something it recalled from a private
// thread, the room cannot see that it did. The capability is deliberate —

// about work discussed in its DM — so the answer is not to block the
// crossing but to make it visible where it lands.
//
// Disclosure is per (room thread, source thread): a bot that searches three
// times in one turn announces each private thread once, not once per search.
// The ledger is in memory, so a restart re-announces. That is the safe
// direction: a duplicate chip is noise, a missing one is the whole bug.
