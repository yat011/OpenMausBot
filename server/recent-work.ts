// What a bot has been doing lately, across all of its conversations.
//
// A bot's 1:1 chats and its rooms are separate conversations on purpose,
// and its memory holds only what stays true — so from inside any one
// conversation the bot had no idea what it did in the others. A morning
// standup then ended in guesses. The fix is not to attach transcripts (the
// prompt budget would go there instead of into the work) but to say, in a
// few lines, the newest thing the bot said in each of its other
// conversations — and to leave one line per finished turn in its daily log,
// so session_search can bring back the detail on demand.
