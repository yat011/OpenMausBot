# Bring Your Own VPS

OpenMausBot can turn a Linux server you already own into a bot's computer. The agent process stays on your
machine; Docker's own SSH transport reaches the daemon on the VPS, and each bot gets one managed, hardened
Cua container there — a Linux desktop it can see and control. SSH is the only credential involved and the
only surface exposed: OpenMausBot never opens a public port on the VPS, never stores your SSH key or
passphrase, and never runs an agent remotely.

## What works

- A per-bot Linux desktop in a managed container on your VPS, driven through the official Cua tools.
- Live screen preview in the Computer panel and in transcripts, same as a Box.
- Explicit **Cloud** with the **Self-hosted VPS** backend provisions or starts the container. **Auto** reuses
  a ready container by default; an off-by-default **Start VPS automatically** switch lets that bot prepare
  or wake its managed container when needed. Scheduled and manually triggered routine runs always start it,
  and never fall back to this computer's own desktop when the VPS cannot be reached.
- Interactive **Take control** locally or from a paired desktop client. The host binds noVNC only to a random
  `127.0.0.1` port, closes the tunnel with the viewer, and never publishes VNC on the VPS. A paired client
  receives a short-lived, device-scoped relay through managed HTTPS or Tailscale only after **Cloud desktop
  access** is enabled for that device on the host.

## Prerequisites

- **Locally:** a `docker` CLI, version 18.09 or newer (that is when `docker -H ssh://` shipped). The Docker
  daemon does not need to run locally — only the CLI is used.
- **On the VPS:** a running Docker daemon (`dockerd`) on x86_64 Linux.
- **The SSH user** must be in the `docker` group on the VPS, so `docker info` works without sudo.

Be clear-eyed about that last point: membership in the `docker` group is root-equivalent on that machine.
Anyone who can talk to the daemon can mount the host filesystem into a container. Using this feature means
trusting the VPS — and whoever else can reach its Docker daemon — completely. Give bots a dedicated server,
not one that also holds things you would not hand to the agent.

## The required SSH config alias

OpenMausBot connects only through a named alias in your `~/.ssh/config` — you type the alias into
App Settings → Connections, nothing else. Every bot action becomes a `docker exec` over SSH, so the app
supplies connection sharing and fail-fast timeouts itself: it runs each VPS command through its own
`ssh_config` (under `~/.openmausbot/ssh/`) that includes your file first and fills in `ControlMaster`,
`ControlPersist`, keepalives and a connect timeout wherever your alias leaves them unset. Anything your
alias sets wins. Startup, previews, bot tools and their connection probes use the same settings.
For long data-directory paths, the app keeps its control socket in a private, user-owned directory
under `/tmp` to stay within OpenSSH's socket-path limit; the config stays in the app data directory.
Windows OpenSSH does not support connection sharing, so that platform keeps its normal SSH setup.
The block below is still the recommended shape, and it is what your own `ssh` uses outside the app:

```
Host my-vps
  HostName 203.0.113.7
  User deploy
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h-%p
  ControlPersist 60m
  ServerAliveInterval 15
  ServerAliveCountMax 3
  ConnectTimeout 10
```

- `ControlMaster`/`ControlPath`/`ControlPersist` — every action is a docker-over-SSH exec; multiplexing turns
  per-command connects into milliseconds over one persistent connection.
- `ServerAliveInterval`/`ServerAliveCountMax`/`ConnectTimeout` — a dropped VPS must fail fast (under a
  minute, and ten seconds to connect), not hang a turn waiting on a dead TCP session.

**Host key first, by hand.** Connect once manually before pointing OpenMausBot at the alias:

```sh
ssh my-vps true
```

That puts the host key in `known_hosts` on your terms. The app never auto-accepts a host key — an alias whose
host is unknown simply fails until you have done this once.

## Security

- **No public ports.** The managed container is created with no published ports, and OpenMausBot refuses to
  use a container that publishes any — the check runs before every attach, not just at creation. Live view
  reaches the container's private bridge address through SSH and is loopback-only on your computer.
- **Firewall the VPS to SSH only**, ideally from your IP. Nothing OpenMausBot does needs any other inbound
  port open, so anything else open is pure attack surface.
- **Nothing sensitive is stored.** The only thing OpenMausBot persists is the alias name itself
  (`~/.openmausbot/config.json`); keys, passphrases, and agent state stay with SSH. The alias is also kept
  off paired phones — the companion reports configured-or-not, never the name.
- The container itself runs hardened: capabilities dropped, private network/IPC/cgroup namespaces, no host
  mounts, and memory/CPU/pid limits. A container missing any of that — including one someone created under
  the managed name — is refused, not repaired.

## Container lifecycle

Each bot owns one container on the VPS, named `openmausbot-vps-<bot>-<hash>` — stable across restarts and
independent of the bot's display name.

- **Provision** (choosing **Cloud** for the bot, or the panel's button): builds the pinned Cua image on the
  VPS if needed, creates the container if missing, starts it if stopped, and waits until the desktop answers.
- **Start** only wakes an existing stopped container; it never creates one.
- **Sleep** stops the container. The VPS stops spending CPU on it; the filesystem stays put.
- **Remove** is yours, done by hand when a bot no longer needs the server:
  `docker -H ssh://my-vps rm -f <container>`. OpenMausBot never deletes a container on its own.

What survives what: sleep/start preserves the container's filesystem; removal — including the recreate that
follows a Cua image upgrade, since a container pinned to an old image is refused rather than reused — wipes
it. Treat the container filesystem as **disposable**: anything a bot must keep should leave the VPS (pushed,
uploaded, or pasted back into chat) before the container is removed.

A bot set to **Auto** is lifecycle-read-only by default. It attaches only when the container is already
running and verified. If no local fallback exists, the turn now explains why the VPS was unavailable instead
of silently running without a computer. Enable **Start VPS automatically** per bot to let Auto prepare or wake
that bot's managed container; the switch is deliberately off by default.

## Several turns at once

Each bot has one container, but the container is not the bottleneck — the desktop inside it is. Any number of
the bot's threads (chats, tasks, routines) can run with the VPS mounted at the same time. The desktop goes to
the first thread that calls a computer tool (a screenshot, a click, a command through the Cua driver) and stays
with that turn until it ends; threads that never touch the computer tools are never held up. A thread that
reaches for the screen while another holds it shows

> Waiting for its turn on this computer — *bot* is running *thread*. Starts automatically when that finishes.

and its computer calls are refused with a note telling the model to pause screen work; the chip settles as
"Computer free — continuing" when the desktop lands, or "Stopped waiting for the computer" if the turn ends
first. A wait gives up after 30 minutes and names the holder. Container lifecycle actions (create, start,
stop) are still one at a time per container.

## Troubleshooting

Normal screen refreshes should not abort new turns with “the VPS is being prepared.”
Turn setup waits for a pending preview, and overlapping preparation requests share the same operation.
Stop and Delete remain exclusive; they do not race a pending capture or silently recreate its container.
If a Docker-over-SSH command times out, the app cleans up that command's Docker/SSH processes before
releasing it. Retry is explicit: potentially mutating commands are never automatically replayed.

Work up the same path the app takes, cheapest signal first:

1. **The alias works by hand:** `ssh my-vps true` returns silently. A password prompt means the key/agent is
   not set up; a host-key prompt means the first manual connect has not happened yet.
2. **Docker over SSH reaches the daemon:** `docker -H ssh://my-vps info` prints server details. A permission
   error means the SSH user is not in the `docker` group.
3. **Provision:** choose **Cloud** with the **Self-hosted VPS** backend in the bot's Computer panel. The
   first provision pulls and builds the Cua image on the VPS, which can take minutes; later ones are fast.
4. **Read the status states.** The panel surfaces exactly what the server found, in check order: alias not
   configured → daemon unreachable → image missing → container missing / stopped → container unmanaged or
   unsafe (ports, mounts, hardening) → desktop not ready. Each message names the step to fix.
