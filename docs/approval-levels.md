# Approval levels

Approval levels belong to a bot and apply to its next provider turn, including
when that provider resumes an existing native thread. Each level is one of the
provider's own permission modes, passed through. OpenMausBot does not judge an
action itself: there is no app-side allowlist, classifier, or pattern rule. A
native tool request that reaches you is one the provider left for you. In Full
Access, OMB also applies its own configuration tools without another approval.

| Level | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Ask for approval** | Requests approval for commands and file changes, the way the provider's supervised mode does. |
| **Auto-accept edits** | Approves file edits automatically; other actions can still require approval. Offered where the provider has such a mode (Claude, Grok, Antigravity). |
| **Approve for me** | Uses the provider's automatic review on Codex, Claude, Cursor, and Grok to approve routine actions and ask about others. Providers without an equivalent fall back to asking. |
| **Full access** | Enables the provider's permissive mode for commands, edits, and selected-computer actions, including potentially destructive or sensitive work. Residual native permission prompts are answered for you. OMB profile changes, routine actions, team setup, bot deletion, and enabled skill authoring apply without a second approval. Peer-review prompts are skipped within the bot's authorized scope. Delegation uses the receiving bot's setting, never the sender's — except from a Chief of Staff with Full access (below). Actual questions and missing credentials still need your input. |
| **Custom (`config.toml`)** | Codex only. OpenMausBot reads and reapplies the effective approval and sandbox settings from your Codex configuration. |

Full access is an elevated-risk standing approval. Full and Custom can only be
enabled from a packaged local desktop app, where the choice crosses a private
process channel rather than the bot-accessible HTTP API. They are hidden in
development, standalone web, and remote pages. Full access does not bypass operating
system privacy controls, authentication, CAPTCHA or MFA, service permissions,
or workspace/team ownership and computer-sharing grants. Full Access controls
approval prompts; it does not sign in for you, enable a feature you disabled,
or grant another bot access to a different workspace.

The effective setting belongs to the source conversation. An existing Ask
thread remains Ask even if the bot default is Full; a Full thread works without
these extra prompts even if the bot default is Ask. Ask, Auto, and Custom retain
their existing OMB configuration review cards. Full actions return an applied
result and leave a settled receipt, so the bot continues in the same turn.
Invalid input, unavailable services, or failed writes return errors, not a
request to approve again. An expired native permission request is not turned
into another Allow/Deny card.

A turn a webhook, a routine, or another bot started runs in the bot's level
like any other turn. The decision log records that nobody was at the keyboard
when such a turn asked.

The terminal CLI can start the whole process in YOLO: `openmausbot serve --yolo`
(or `OMB_YOLO=1`). That maps every supported engine's turns to Full access for
that process only. It does not persist Full on the bot, and HTTP still cannot
elevate a bot to Full.

### A Chief of Staff's Full access covers the work it delegates

Approvals were where a team's owner spent their day: every teammate a Chief
handed work to stopped that work to ask the owner, one card every few
minutes, across the whole team. So a **Chief of Staff with Full access passes
that access on**. Work it delegates from a Full-access conversation —
`delegate_bot`, and `coordinate_bots` into a teammate's thread — runs with
Full access whatever the teammate's own level: the delegated thread is
switched to Full, stays Full, and opens with a line saying so ("Full access —
delegated by Clive, a Chief of Staff with Full access"). Work a Full-access
Chief hands out inside a room runs Full for that turn. The teammate's own
default and its other conversations do not change; a teammate whose engine
has no Full mode keeps its own level; an ordinary bot's delegation still uses
the recipient's setting; a Chief delegating from an Ask conversation passes
nothing on. Questions and missing credentials still reach you.

## Answering a request

Approve or deny requests in the conversation to let the bot continue. **Allow
once** answers this request only. **Always allow this session** hands the
provider its own remembered approval: Claude receives its suggested permission
rules, and ACP agents such as Grok receive their `allow_always` option, or the
driver repeats your answer for that exact operation until the native session
ends. OpenMausBot keeps no standing grant for a provider's tool. It is not
offered for computer control or for a sandbox change.

Auto-accept edits and Ask card whatever the provider asks about. Approve for
me cards whatever the provider's reviewer leaves for you, with the note "The
provider requires your approval for this action." A sandbox widening is held
in every level but Full.

### When the native reviewer never starts

Claude Code accepts `--permission-mode auto` for every model and, when auto
mode is unavailable to the session, starts in Manual without an error. On
Claude Code 2.1.266 that is the case for Claude Haiku 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5,
and for any organization that set `disableAutoMode`. In that session the bot
asks before each action. The Claude driver reads the mode the session actually
runs in from the CLI's `init` frame; when Approve for me was requested and the
session runs Manual, the chat shows one notice per session naming the model.
Choose a model the reviewer supports, Auto-accept edits, or Full access to
stop the prompts.

### Antigravity: Ask, Edits, or Auto (full access)

For Antigravity, the composer and bot settings offer **Ask for approval**,
**Auto-accept edits** (its native `auto_edit` mode), and **Auto (full access)**.
Auto enables native `yolo` mode and automatically approves remaining
tool-permission requests for commands, edits, and computer actions, without an
automatic reviewer. The composer chip reads **Auto**. This uses the existing
Full access grant and confirmation, not a separate permission setting, and
applies to every model in that Antigravity instance, including Gemini.

Choose Auto explicitly in the local packaged desktop app. Old Antigravity
`auto` / `autoApprove` settings still behave as Ask and are displayed as Ask;
they never become unrestricted access on upgrade. Switching back to Ask
restores prompts on the next turn. Questions and missing-credential forms
still require an answer. A Chief or
teammate can delegate work to this bot without downgrading its explicit Auto
(full access) grant. It does not enable Auto on any other bot.

## Asking you questions

Every engine can stop and ask, and no approval level ever answers a question
for you: Ask, Auto-accept edits, Auto, and Full access all leave a question
card for a person. What differs per engine is only how the ask travels:

| Engine family | How an ask travels | Multiple questions at once |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Structured round-trip (its own `AskUserQuestion`) | Yes — capped at 4 by the CLI |
| Codex | Structured round-trip | Yes — up to 6 |
| Grok Build, Minimax, OpenAI-compatible endpoints | The injected `ask_user` tool | Yes — up to 6 |
| ACP engines (Cursor, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, OpenCode, …) | Option-match round-trip on the ACP permission request | One at a time — the request carries one choice set |
| Pi | Free-text round-trip over `extension_ui_request` | One at a time |
| BoxAgent (cloud computer) | A fenced `omb-ask` block in the run's final output; the turn stays open until you answer or the ask times out | Yes — up to 6 |

A question the harness parsed out of model-authored output rather than a
real tool call — the BoxAgent transport — carries an "Agent-composed
question" badge on the card, and the decision log records it with
`origin: output`. Flat clients (notifications, older companion builds)
see plain buttons only when a card asks a single choice question; a
multi-question card renders its structured form on current apps instead.

## Provider mappings

| Provider | Ask | Auto-accept edits | Auto | Full access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `on-request` approvals, `workspace-write` sandbox, you review | not offered (Ask already writes in the workspace) | same sandbox, native `auto_review` reviewer | `never` approvals, `danger-full-access` sandbox |
| Claude | Native `default` | Native `acceptEdits` | Native `auto` | Native `bypassPermissions` |
| Cursor | Native default | not offered | Native `--auto-review` | Native `--force` |
| Antigravity | Native `default` | Native `auto_edit` | Legacy `auto` behaves as Ask; UI Auto selects Full access | Native `yolo` plus automatic approval of remaining tool-permission requests; shown as Auto |
| Grok Build | Native `default` | Native `acceptEdits` | Native `--permission-mode auto`; availability of Grok's reviewer depends on its feature rollout | Native `bypassPermissions` plus automatic approval of remaining tool-permission requests |
| Muse Code | Native `--approval-mode on-request` | not offered | not offered | Native `--yolo` (disable approval, disable sandbox, trust this workspace). `--approval-mode never` is not Full: sandbox stays on and the workspace stays untrusted. |
| OpenCode | Ask | not offered | Ask | Approve individual ACP permission requests, never task questions |
| Qwen Code | Native `default` | Native `--approval-mode auto-edit` | Native `--approval-mode auto` (Qwen's LLM classifier approves safe actions, blocks risky ones) | `--yolo`, plus automatic approval of remaining ACP permission requests |
| Gemini CLI | Native `default` | Native `--approval-mode auto_edit` | Ask (no reviewer) | `--yolo`, plus automatic approval of remaining ACP permission requests |
| Other/custom engines | Ask | not offered | Ask | Not offered until a provider mapping is implemented |

These settings apply on each turn, including resumed conversations. Switching
to a different provider while elevated requires leaving Full/Custom first;
choose Ask. Switching models within Antigravity keeps the selected level.
Native modes require a CLI version that supports them; OpenMausBot does not
silently substitute unrestricted access when a mode is rejected.

### Read-only integration tools

OpenMausBot's built-in agents MCP server describes nine scoped reads with
explicit read-only, non-destructive, idempotent, closed-world metadata:
`list_bots`, `list_rooms`, `list_threads`, `check_delegation`, `wait_delegation`,
`session_search`, `session_read`, `list_routines`, and `skills_list`.
Session recall still enforces own-bot access and records its existing room
disclosure audit. These hints do not grant access to another bot's conversations.
Writes, credential requests, proposals, and third-party tools do not inherit
these hints. The metadata is available to every engine using this integration;
whether an engine consumes it remains that engine's behavior. Arbitrary MCP
display titles or `readOnlyHint` claims from a third-party server are not
authorization to bypass a prompt.

The level set follows the provider-boundary approach in
[T3 Code's permission modes](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/blob/e16b8b059c9f5ff6dfed1addecffb831c6aee043/docs/user/permission-modes.md):
Supervised, Auto-accept edits, Auto, and Full access, each a provider mode
rather than an app rule, with a remembered approval that belongs to the
provider's session. Its quieter default is Full access; OpenMausBot keeps its
own opt-in desktop confirmation and Ask as the default.

## Verification for contributors

The [Full Access workflow recipe](verification/full-access.md) tests immediate
profile, routine, team, skill, and peer actions through the real server and MCP
proxy. Its fixture also verifies that explicit Ask sibling threads still wait.

Run `pnpm exec electron scripts/smoke-approval-modes.cjs` to exercise the real
private desktop-to-server grant protocol in a disposable fixture. It verifies
HTTP elevation rejection, Full → Auto → Ask on resumed Claude turns, and
Antigravity automatic tool approvals on new and resumed Full access turns across
multiple model variants. It also checks that Ask and legacy Auto still prompt,
peer-started Full turns auto-approve, switching the receiving bot back to Ask
restores prompts even for a Full-access sender, delegated Codex Custom uses the
native Auto reviewer consistently, and questions remain interactive. Provider
processes are scripted fakes; this does not verify live account eligibility or
the quality of a provider's automatic reviewer. No live user data is used.
Grok coverage exercises two model selections across fresh/resumed Auto turns,
real built-in MCP reads under a scripted native reviewer, returning to Ask,
and held deletion, credential, spoofed-title command, and question requests.
