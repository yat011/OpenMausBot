# Approval levels

Approval levels belong to a bot and apply to its next provider turn, including
when that provider resumes an existing native thread. Each level is one of the
provider's own permission modes, passed through. OpenMausBot does not judge an
action itself: there is no app-side allowlist, classifier, or pattern rule. A
request that reaches you is one the provider left for you.

| Level | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Ask for approval** | Requests approval for commands and file changes, the way the provider's supervised mode does. |
| **Auto-accept edits** | Approves file edits automatically; other actions can still require approval. Offered where the provider has such a mode (Claude, Grok, Antigravity). |
| **Approve for me** | Uses the provider's automatic review on Codex, Claude, Cursor, and Grok to approve routine actions and ask about others. Providers without an equivalent fall back to asking. |
| **Full access** | Enables the provider's permissive mode for commands, edits, and selected-computer actions, including potentially destructive or sensitive work. Residual native prompts are answered for you. Applies to this bot's direct, scheduled, and delegated work (ask_bot, delegate_bot); delegation uses the receiving bot's setting, never the sender's. Questions and separate OpenMausBot confirmations still wait for you. |
| **Custom (`config.toml`)** | Codex only. OpenMausBot reads and reapplies the effective approval and sandbox settings from your Codex configuration. |

Full access is an elevated-risk standing approval. Full and Custom can only be
enabled from a packaged local desktop app, where the choice crosses a private
process channel rather than the bot-accessible HTTP API. They are hidden in
development, standalone web, and remote pages. Full access does not bypass operating
system privacy controls, authentication, CAPTCHA or MFA, service permissions,
or OpenMausBot's separate confirmations for credentials, routines, skills, and
peer communication.

A turn a webhook, a routine, or another bot started runs in the bot's level
like any other turn. The decision log records that nobody was at the keyboard
when such a turn asked.

The terminal CLI can start the whole process in YOLO: `openmausbot serve --yolo`
(or `OMB_YOLO=1`). That maps every supported engine's turns to Full access for
that process only. It does not persist Full on the bot, and HTTP still cannot
elevate a bot to Full.

## Answering a request

Approve or deny requests in the conversation to let the bot continue. **Allow
once** answers this request only. **Always allow this session** hands the
provider its own remembered approval: Claude receives its suggested permission
rules, and ACP agents such as Grok receive their `allow_always` option, or the
driver repeats your answer for that exact operation until the native session
ends. OpenMausBot keeps no standing grant for a provider's tool. It is not
offered for computer control or for a sandbox change.

Auto-accept edits and Ask card whatever the provider asks about. Approve for
me cards whatever the provider's reviewer leaves for you, with the note "The
provider requires your approval for this action." A sandbox widening is held
in every level but Full.

### When the native reviewer never starts

Claude Code accepts `--permission-mode auto` for every model and, when auto
mode is unavailable to the session, starts in Manual without an error. On
Claude Code 2.1.266 that is the case for Claude Haiku 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5,
and for any organization that set `disableAutoMode`. In that session the bot
asks before each action. The Claude driver reads the mode the session actually
runs in from the CLI's `init` frame; when Approve for me was requested and the
session runs Manual, the chat shows one notice per session naming the model.
Choose a model the reviewer supports, Auto-accept edits, or Full access to
stop the prompts.

### Antigravity: Ask, Edits, or Auto (full access)

For Antigravity, the composer and bot settings offer **Ask for approval**,
**Auto-accept edits** (its native `auto_edit` mode), and **Auto (full access)**.
Auto enables native `yolo` mode and automatically approves remaining
tool-permission requests for commands, edits, and computer actions, without an
automatic reviewer. The composer chip reads **Auto**. This uses the existing
Full access grant and confirmation, not a separate permission setting, and
applies to every model in that Antigravity instance, including Gemini.

Choose Auto explicitly in the local packaged desktop app. Old Antigravity
`auto` / `autoApprove` settings still behave as Ask and are displayed as Ask;
they never become unrestricted access on upgrade. Switching back to Ask
restores prompts on the next turn. Questions, credential forms, and the
separate confirmations described above still require an answer. A Chief or
teammate can delegate work to this bot without downgrading its explicit Auto
(full access) grant. It does not enable Auto on any other bot.

## Provider mappings

| Provider | Ask | Auto-accept edits | Auto | Full access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `on-request` approvals, `workspace-write` sandbox, you review | not offered (Ask already writes in the workspace) | same sandbox, native `auto_review` reviewer | `never` approvals, `danger-full-access` sandbox |
| Claude | Native `default` | Native `acceptEdits` | Native `auto` | Native `bypassPermissions` |
| Cursor | Native default | not offered | Native `--auto-review` | Native `--force` |
| Antigravity | Native `default` | Native `auto_edit` | Legacy `auto` behaves as Ask; UI Auto selects Full access | Native `yolo` plus automatic approval of remaining tool-permission requests; shown as Auto |
| Grok Build | Native `default` | Native `acceptEdits` | Native `--permission-mode auto`; availability of Grok's reviewer depends on its feature rollout | Native `bypassPermissions`; remaining native requests still appear |
| OpenCode | Ask | not offered | Ask | Approve individual ACP permission requests, never task questions |
| Other/custom engines | Ask | not offered | Ask | Not offered until a provider mapping is implemented |

These settings apply on each turn, including resumed conversations. Switching
to a different provider while elevated requires leaving Full/Custom first;
choose Ask. Switching models within Antigravity keeps the selected level.
Native modes require a CLI version that supports them; OpenMausBot does not
silently substitute unrestricted access when a mode is rejected.

### Read-only integration tools

OpenMausBot's built-in agents MCP server describes nine scoped reads with
explicit read-only, non-destructive, idempotent, closed-world metadata:
`list_bots`, `list_rooms`, `list_threads`, `check_delegation`, `wait_delegation`,
`session_search`, `session_read`, `list_routines`, and `skills_list`.
Session recall still enforces own-bot access and records its existing room
disclosure audit. These hints do not grant access to another bot's conversations.
Writes, credential requests, proposals, and third-party tools do not inherit
these hints. The metadata is available to every engine using this integration;
whether an engine consumes it remains that engine's behavior. Arbitrary MCP
display titles or `readOnlyHint` claims from a third-party server are not
authorization to bypass a prompt.

The level set follows the provider-boundary approach in
[T3 Code's permission modes](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/blob/e16b8b059c9f5ff6dfed1addecffb831c6aee043/docs/user/permission-modes.md):
Supervised, Auto-accept edits, Auto, and Full access, each a provider mode
rather than an app rule, with a remembered approval that belongs to the
provider's session. Its quieter default is Full access; OpenMausBot keeps its
own opt-in desktop confirmation and Ask as the default.

## Verification for contributors

Run `pnpm exec electron scripts/smoke-approval-modes.cjs` to exercise the real
private desktop-to-server grant protocol in a disposable fixture. It verifies
HTTP elevation rejection, Full → Auto → Ask on resumed Claude turns, and
Antigravity automatic tool approvals on new and resumed Full access turns across
multiple model variants. It also checks that Ask and legacy Auto still prompt,
peer-started Full turns auto-approve, switching the receiving bot back to Ask
restores prompts even for a Full-access sender, delegated Codex Custom uses the
native Auto reviewer consistently, and questions remain interactive. Provider
processes are scripted fakes; this does not verify live account eligibility or
the quality of a provider's automatic reviewer. No live user data is used.
Grok coverage exercises two model selections across fresh/resumed Auto turns,
real built-in MCP reads under a scripted native reviewer, returning to Ask,
and held deletion, credential, spoofed-title command, and question requests.
