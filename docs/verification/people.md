# Adding people to a hosted workspace

## Sub-features

- Settings → People: who may sign in with an emailed code, their role, when
  each person was last seen, what they spent this month, and an invite link
  per person that opens the sign-in page with the address filled in.
- The owner (or a bootstrap script on the box) names the first admin; from
  then on any admin invites, promotes, demotes and removes people from the
  card. Promotions apply at the next sign-in; removal and lost permissions
  revoke existing account sessions immediately.
- Removing someone also ends their open account streams and stream tickets.
  Independently paired devices remain under Remote access management.

- On a workspace whose members the organization's Admin manages
  (`OMB_ADMIN_MEMBERSHIP=portal`) the card is read-only: who has signed in,
  what they spent, and a **Manage people in Admin** link
  (`<OMB_ADMIN_URL>/people?workspace=<slug>`, from `GET /api/config`
  `membership.peopleUrl`). Remote access there lists signed-in devices and
  offers no pairing code, since a hosted workspace refuses them.

## Driving it

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/people-invite.test.ts server/email-signin.test.ts src/components/PeopleSection.test.ts src/lib/session.test.ts
```

`server/people-invite.test.ts` boots the real server with no sign-in list and a
stubbed control plane, then walks the card's own requests: the owner adds the
first admin, the admin signs in with the emailed code and invites a member,
the member's link serves the sign-in page, the member gets a chat-only cookie
session and cannot change the list, a promotion applies to the next sign-in
while the device already issued keeps its scopes, a removal refuses new
sign-ins and revokes all old account cookies and tickets, and a `@domain` entry
welcomes everyone there and nobody at a look-alike domain.

In the served UI, on a server with a public address: open Settings → People
(the profile menu at the bottom of the sidebar, then Settings), type an
address, pick a role, press Invite. The address appears in the table and the
invite link shows above it. Open that link in another browser: the sign-in
page has the address filled in and the address is gone from the address bar;
the code arrives by email; after it, the app opens as that person and the
People card (Refresh) shows their device and "Today". Remove them: they drop
from the table at once, a new sign-in for them is refused, and their current
account sessions end. Reinviting them requires a fresh sign-in; old cookies
do not regain access.

## Not proven here

The real emailed code comes from the control plane, so a live run needs an
address you can read. Removing the last admin is allowed and turns email
sign-in off until someone on the box, or an independently paired
administrator, adds an entry again.
