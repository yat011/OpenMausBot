# Workspaces screen and the fleet agent

## Sub-features

- A root agent on a Unix socket only the operator's user may open, planning
  and running fleet operations, writing an audit line per action.
- Operator-server routes under `/api/fleet` that forward to the agent, admin
  scope plus the `admin` entitlement, 404 without an agent.
- Settings → Installations: list with state and this month's cost, create, users,
  suspend, resume, delete (with keep-data), upgrade all.

## Driving it

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/fleet-agent.test.ts server/fleet-cli.test.ts server/fleet-cli-filesystem.test.ts server/fleet.test.ts src/components/WorkspacesSection.test.ts server/request-auth.test.ts
```

The agent test boots the real agent on a temporary socket over a recording
machine with a temporary filesystem root, drives create, list (reading a
workspace's own ledger for the month through the usage dependency seam), users, suspend and delete through the
same client the operator server uses, checks the audit log names every action
and never a key, and checks refusals: bad names, unknown operations, a failed
step reported without the tool's secrets, and a plain message when no agent
exists.

The fleet filesystem suite runs the actual unprivileged child on disposable
ledgers, including hostile links, special files and oversized input. The
agent socket fixture checks that unsafe usage returns unavailable/null totals
without failing other workspace rows or echoing file contents. Neither this
fixture performs a root deployment or proves actual
root-to-tenant transitions; qualification still requires a disposable Linux
server with the real service identities and protections.

On a real server, after `openmausbot fleet init --domain <domain> --operator
<user>` as root: `systemctl status openmausbot-fleet`, then `ls -l
/run/openmausbot/fleet.sock` must show `root:<user>` and mode 660. Sign in to
the operator workspace and open Settings → Installations. Create one, add a
member, suspend and resume it, and confirm `/var/log/openmausbot/fleet.jsonl`
grew a line per action. A workspace other than the operator's must get 502
from `/api/fleet`, because it cannot open the socket.

## Not proven here

The real server steps need root, systemd, nftables and Caddy; the renderer's
forms are proven from fixtures, not driven headlessly.
