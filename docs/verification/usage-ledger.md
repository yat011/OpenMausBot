# Usage ledger

## Sub-features

- Append one row per settled turn to `<data>/usage/YYYY-MM.jsonl`: bot, model,
  engine, tokens, the cost with where it came from (`costSource: "reported"`
  from the engine, or `"estimated"` from list prices when the engine reports
  tokens but no price), and who asked.
- Book each turn to the sender of the message that started it, captured when
  the message was accepted. A message that queues behind someone else's turn,
  or is steered into it, or someone pressing Steer, does not re-book that
  turn; the queued message's own turn is booked to its sender. A guarded relay
  (the Slack worker) may name the person it acts for with `onBehalfOf`.
- Name the asker: the email a person signed in with, else their device label;
  this computer for loopback; the routine; or "bot to bot" for a peer hop.
- Read a period back grouped by bot, model, person, day or engine, and export
  one CSV line per turn. Owners only; a chat-only device gets 403.
- Keep message text out of the ledger.

## User path

Settings → Usage shows the live per-bot card and, below it, **History**: pick
a period, group it, or **Export CSV**.

## Driving it

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run --no-file-parallelism server/usage-ledger-api.test.ts server/usage-attribution.e2e.test.ts
```

The test launches a fresh `control-omb` fixture with the repository's fake
engine, creates a bot, sends one turn as the owner through the control surface
and one as a paired device with a label, waits for both to settle, then checks
the month file has exactly two rows with the right triggers and no message
text, that `GET /api/usage` groups them by person and by bot with the fake
engine's `0.01` per turn, that `GET /api/usage.csv` returns three lines, and
that a client-scoped device is refused. It prints the fixture's server log
path as evidence and removes its temporary home.

`server/usage-attribution.e2e.test.ts` boots the server against the fake Claude, ACP
and Codex engines in a disposable home and reads the month file back: an ACP
turn on `grok-4.7` is booked at xAI's list price and marked estimated while an
unlisted model stays unpriced; a paired person's queued message, a live steer
and a queue Steer leave the owner's running turn booked to the owner, while
the queued message's own turn (1:1 and in a room) is the person's; and a
guarded send with `onBehalfOf` is booked to that person, one without it to
this machine, and a chat-only device cannot reach the route at all.

For the same by hand:

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/control-omb.ts launch
pnpm control:omb new-bot --name Probe --url http://127.0.0.1:PORT
pnpm control:omb send --bot BOT_ID --text "hello" --url http://127.0.0.1:PORT
pnpm control:omb wait --bot BOT_ID --timeout 30 --url http://127.0.0.1:PORT
cat DATA_DIR/usage/$(date -u +%Y-%m).jsonl
```

Then open the printed preview, go to Settings → Usage → History, and confirm
the turn appears under **Bot** and under **Person** as "This computer".

## Unit regressions

The chat header's input/output breakdown has a separate real-renderer fixture:

```sh
OMB_UI_E2E=1 pnpm exec vitest run scripts/testing/usage-details-ui.e2e.test.ts
```

It launches a disposable app, sends one scripted-engine turn through the composer,
waits for settlement, and checks that the tooltip separates 10 uncached input,
2 cached input, and 5 output tokens. The synthetic $0.01 cost remains the compact
headline. Its JSON evidence sits next to the fixture log; no live account is used.

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/usage-ledger.test.ts src/components/UsageHistory.test.ts server/request-auth.test.ts
```

These cover month files and 0600 modes, torn lines, clamped tokens, a blocked
directory never failing the turn, range parsing, every grouping, spreadsheet
formula neutralisation in the CSV, the localized person labels, and the admin
scope on both routes.

## Gotchas

- Rows are appended when `turn.completed` folds. A turn that fails before it
  settles leaves no row, so a failed turn is not billed.
- The cost column is what the engine reported (real on a metered key, an
  equivalent on a subscription) or, for engines that report none, an estimate
  from `server/model-prices.ts`, marked `~` in History and People and labelled
  in the CSV's `cost_source` column. A model with no known price stays
  unpriced; the summary counts those turns separately instead of treating them
  as free.
- The renderer's History card is not driven headlessly here; the fixture
  proves the server side and the table renders from a fixture in its unit test.
