# Licensing

OpenMausBot is open source under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE), with one
carve-out and a few notes.

## The carve-out: `enterprise/`

Everything under `enterprise/` is source-available under the
[OpenMausBot Enterprise License](enterprise/LICENSE), not Apache 2.0. You may
read, build, and evaluate it, and run it freely in development and test.
Running its features in production needs a license key issued for your
organisation. Hosting it for third parties or white-labelling the product needs
a partner agreement.

Delete the folder and what remains is the open-source edition: the server
reports `{"edition":"oss"}` and ordinary standalone operation is unchanged.
A workspace explicitly configured for hosted sign-in refuses remote access
without that optional adapter; removing the enterprise layer must not bypass
its configured sign-in authority. The `open-source edition builds without
enterprise/` CI job proves the OSS build, boot response and absent adapter
factory; it does not exercise every hosted HTTP route. The isolated hosted
workspace tests verify those sign-in and revocation paths separately. The list
of entitlement ids the server understands is in [`enterprise/FEATURES`](enterprise/FEATURES).

The routing rule for new work: could any open-source user want it? Then it goes
in core, as a public pull request. Organisation-, admin- or tier-flavoured?
Then it lives in `enterprise/` behind an entitlement. Customer-specific brand,
skills, packages or connectors belong in that customer's own repository as
data and configuration, never as a fork.

## Contributions

- Outside `enterprise/`: contribute under Apache 2.0. No DCO sign-off or CLA is
  required. Submit only code you wrote or have the right to contribute.
- Inside `enterprise/`: sign the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md) once, by
  commenting on your pull request. It lets the project keep that folder under
  its own license while still accepting your work.
- The open-core boundary, the cloud seam and this file are covered by
  [`CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS): a maintainer reviews changes there.

## Third-party components and trademarks

Bundled third-party software keeps its own licenses; notices, license texts,
source locations and the SBOM are listed in [NOTICE](NOTICE) and
[`third_party/`](third_party/). The OpenMausBot name and mascot are trademarks
of Milind Soni; the Apache License does not grant trademark rights (section 6),
so a product built on OpenMausBot needs its own name unless a partner agreement
says otherwise.
